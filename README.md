The impetus for this project is to:
- create an open source knowledge map of web3 development.
- allow for an easy way to contribute to collective knowledge for anyone
- provide a roadmap from beginner to advanced expert
- provide a mind map linking all concepts in web3 in a clear and understable manner.
- provide a location where people can collaborate on their notes, learn from each other instead of working in isolation. 

This was inspired by the **[secureum-mind_map](https://github.com/x676f64/secureum-mind_map)**Public. It in turn was inspired by the content [0xRajeev](https://twitter.com/0xRajeev) has produced. 

Like the orginal project, we'd like to create some cool graphs and play with Obsidian. :)

If you open this in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) you can graph the notes.

## About Obsidian
Its a great tool to create knowledge graphs and is extensible, so anyone can create cool plugins. See the features from the [website](https://obsidian.md/) .

If you'd like to see an example of a communal knowledge base, check out this site around [Classical Quantum Physics]().

Also, writing on Obsidian is pretty easy and fun, and all documents are Markdown files. Its more useful than writing Markdown files in VS Code or a text editor

Its the tool of choice for the creator of the Rust programming language:
> Obsidian is my current choice for writing and organizing notes on any complicated subject. Feels like the closest anyone has come yet to realizing the promise of hypertext as a tool of thought.
